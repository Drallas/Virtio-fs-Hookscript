# Virtio-fs-Hookscript

Hookscript to create Virtio-fs mounts, to share a directory tree on a Proxmox host with VMs.

For a more detailed explaination how this works, see my Gist [Mount Volumes into Proxmox VMs with Virtio-fs](https://gist.github.com/Drallas/7e4a6f6f36610eeb0bbb5d011c8ca0be#file-set-hook-script-sh).

The source of the script is this [Proxmox Forums tutorial](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/virtiofsd-in-pve-8-0-x.130531/) and it has been modified by [@dvino](https://gist.github.com/dvino) and myself to be more flexible.
